\begin_layout Chapter
Local conditions on the universal peace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following case analysis of Sri Lanka is a long-term analysis based on
 above discussed body of literature.
 It seeks to highlight how the principled donors, despite having operationalised
 the emancipatory gradient which privileges achievement of justice through
 local actors, failed on account of their unwillingness to engage with,
 what from their perspective were, “uncivil” sections of the Sri Lankan
 civil society.
 In the conflict era, the source of friction is located in the competing
 visions of what a stable negotiated peace in Sri Lanka would entail : The
 peacebuilders and local collaborators actively advocated for a federal
 solution and devolution of power to the Tamil dominated Province.
 However, for certain local factions, this represented a Balkanisation of
 the Sri Lankan state and an undermining of, what they constructed as, the
 fundamental Sinhalese Buddhist nature of Sri Lanka.
 This ‘local’ sentiment that strictly advocated for the maintenance of a
 unitary state found traction among the masses, due to its ethno-nationalist
 overtones.
 Following the failure of the peace negotiations, the outcome of this friction
 was a rejection response by these local groups, due to the peacebuilders
 continued unwillingness to have a dialogue with what they saw as ‘spoilers.’
 The local rejection took form of a mass attack against local organisations
 that worked with peacebuilders, which were represented as “traitors,” “LTTE-sym
pathisers” and “unpatriotic.” It marks the first set of de-facto conditionalities
 by local actors that reduced the space for peacebuilding and carried on
 into the post-conflict era, by effectively limiting the willingness of
 local actors to collaborate with the international community To illustrate
 the process by which this rejection response was successful, this section
 focuses on the unlikely alliance between the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna
 (JVP), a marginal communist group that had existed since 1965, and JHU,
 a faction that represents the interests of the radical Buddhist clergy.
 The alliance highlights how disparate groups with fundamentally different
 ideologies united with the common goal of repelling Western peacebuilders.
 Following the end of the peace-negotiations, both these marginal parties
 have became dominant political groups and have since redefined the post-conflic
t space in Sri Lanka.

This chapter begins with an exploration of Western peacebuilding work and
 its historical trajectory in order to justify its focus on the ethical-principl
ed donors alone.
 It then explores the nature of the Sri Lankan political landscape, briefly
 discussing the ethno-nationalist Sinhalese-Buddhist axis that politics
 in Sri Lanka has historically coalesced around.
 Finally, this chapter explores the failure of peacebuilding in the conflict
 era, on account of its limited and tenuous engagement with an elite civil
 society, which played a role in the local rejection response to the friction
 on what peace would mean for the structuring of the Sri Lankan state.

\begin_layout Section
 Aid, Conflict, and Peacebuilding in Sri Lanka
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically following the outbreak of the conflict in 1983, except for
 India which has a historic ethnic association with the Tamils, no other
 country made an attempt at a high level intervention in the form of peace-makin
g efforts in the Sri Lankan context.
 Goodhand argues that lack of this form of Western engagement in the region
 till 2000 can be attributed to two reasons - first, the conflict was seen
 as an internal ethnic issue and both warring factions within the country
 had been against any sort of external engagement in the matter, viewing
 it as a transgression of national sovereignty.
 Second, during the Cold War and after, most Western states regarded India
 as the natural region hegemon, and countries like the US particularly,
 did not see any geo-strategic value in intervening in the region.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "goodhand2009limits"

\end_inset

 Despite this, it would be reductive to categorise the Sri Lankan conflict
 as an ‘introverted’ ethnic conflict; most academics have argued that what
 appears to be ‘internal’ is actually the result of successive complex political
, economic and cultural engagements with the outside world.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Several scholars have reasoned that particularly in the last decade of
 the conflict, the domestic dynamics in terms of government - LTTE relations
 continued to be more or less at an impasse, and it was the nature and limitatio
ns of the international intervention that influenced the course and eventual
 end of the civil war.

Debates on peacebuilding that focus on the Sri Lankan experience, have implied
 a level of homogeneity among international actors that has not existed
 in practice, by focusing on ‘Western experience’ of peacebuilding during
 the brief period of alignment that emerged between donors in Sri Lanka
 from 2000-2005.
 Contrary to the general tendency of subsuming all Western aid behaviour
 as a singular collective, there has historically been a distinct difference
 in the way the P-3 – USA, UK and France, with Australia, and smaller European
 donors like Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands and Germany, have
 worked on peacebuilding and engagement with conflict, both globally and
 in Sri Lanka.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goodhand2005aid"

\end_inset

 Bellamy and Williams describe this as a difference in approach between
 the ‘great powers,’ i.e the P3 of US, UK and France, who have traditionally
 been more strategic in their interventions, and the ‘internationalist’
 middle powers, like the Scandinavian states, Netherlands and Germany, who
 were motivated by the principles of liberal peace.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Till 2001, among the Western superpowers only the UK engaged with Sri Lanka
 to a limited degree on conflict related issues, on account of the country’s
 status as a former colony; the other superpowers considered this a ‘domestic
 issue’ that was the immediate international responsibility of India, which
 was widely considered the regional hegemon.
 Major Western bilateral donors like the US and Australia, preferred to
 focus on issue of trade and technical cooperation, treating the conflict
 as a ‘negative externality’ that at best had to be factored in while designing
 programmes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This distinction between bilateral donors that view aid as a foreign policy
 tool and allocate it based on political and strategic considerations, as
 opposed to donors that have a more ‘principled’ allocation of aid based
 on more ‘correct’ considerations has long been discussed in literature
 focused on political economy of the global aid system.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "alesina2000gives"

\end_inset

 With regards to the former group of ‘political-strategic’ donors, consideration
s like geo-political interests, colonial history and economic interests
 are among the prime determinants of aid allocation; concerns regarding
 democratisation and good governance are recognised as being secondary to
 geo-political concerns.
 Among Western donors, most account have defined this group as consisting
 of former imperialist nations, like the UK, France, Portugal and Spain,
 as well as dominant powers like the US.
 The second group of donors are motivated by what Lumsdaine describes as
 a ‘moral’ vision, which is based on their self-perception as enablers of
 a liberal system in the global order.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 While the Scandinavian countries are looked at as the most typical example,
 Germany, Netherlands and Canada are also often discussed as belonging to
 this group; however this is based on their aggregated behaviours across
 contexts.
 This thesis, in focusing on the bilateral peacebuilding by the ethical-principl
ed donors in post-conflict Sri Lanka, refers to the work done by Switzerland,
 Norway, Sweden,and Germany, and aid from Denmark, Finland, and Iceland.

Some accounts discuss Australia and Canada as being ethical-principled donors.
 While this may have been true during the Cold War Era, in the last decade,
 the aid practices and donor agency direction has largerly reflected more
 political strategic donor like behaviour; in the view of this researcher,
 the merger of the Canadian International Development Agency into the Canadian
 Department of Foreign Affairs and AusAid with the Australian Department
 of Foreign Affairs in the last three years, effectively signals an end
 to their potential status as 'ethical-principled’ donors.

It is recognised that following the collapse of the peace-negotiations,
 the political-strategic Western donors returned to their ‘pre-internationalisat
ion risk-averse behaviour,’ marking the re-emergence of the three-fold distincti
on of donors that worked ‘around conflict’, ‘on conflict’ and ‘in conflict.’
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 As Goodhand highlights, the aid landscape in Sri Lanka during and after
 the conflict was interesting in that those who has the least financial
 and global political influence, i.e the like-minded donors, prioritised
 peacebuilding the longest.
 However, the lack of resources is in noway indicative of the influence
 these donors have had on policy and agenda setting.
 Donors like Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands have had a long historical
 ties with Sri Lanka, as a result of which, their political influence in
 Sri Lanka has been disproportionate to their funding.
 Moreover, these donors have played an important norm setting role in influencin
g the behaviours and priorities of more financially significant donors by
 repeatedly bringing up peacebuilding concerns in collective donor forums.

\begin_layout Standard
In this respect, the peace window from 2000-2005 is widely regarded as the
 high point of aligned international interest and intervention in the Sri
 Lankan conflict.
 It must be stressed that collective Western intervention occurred as a
 result of a domestic shift and demand, rather than being imposed by donors,
 thus highlighting the primacy of domestic agents in the eventual process.
 The key domestic changes that allowed for this window, was the election
 of the West leaning United National Front (UNP
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

description "United National Front coalition, led by Ranil Wickremasinghe"

\end_inset

) coalition, led by Ranil Wickremasinghe in December 2001.
 The previous government had already initiated the process of talks with
 the LTTE and requested Norwegian mediation in early 2000, however, it was
 really under Wickremasinghe that the internationalisation of the conflict
 developed to its mammoth proportions.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The UNP administration sought to link peace-talks with the LTTE to the
 economic development of the country as a whole, with specific focus on
 the conflict affected regions of the North and East, in line with international
 expectations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Bastian highlights, the UNF’s intended strategy was designed in line
 with the ‘liberal peace’ discourse, and thus forwarded the idea that conducting
 peace-talks against the implementation of free-market economic reforms
 and liberal ‘good’ governance would leading to a durable peace.

 This thus effectively linked security with the development agenda, echoing
 the sentiments of Western superpowers like the US and UK which had only
 recently announced their global agenda against terrorism, which placed
 emphasis on the same nexus.
 This meant that the success of the Sri Lankan peace negotiations had high
 stakes not only domestically, but internationally.
 Lunstead, in his discussion on the nature of superpower engagement in Sri
 Lanka, highlights that the immediate trigger for intensive Western superpower
 engagement in Sri Lanka from 2001 onwards was the post 9/11 agenda.
 Under the then Deputy-Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, it was felt
 that any Western success in resolving the Sri Lankan conflict through mediated
 negotiations would make the country a poster-child for new US-sponsored
 global agenda for promoting democracy and interventionism.

The acceptance of Norway as a neutral third mediator by both warring parties
 in 2001 and the signing of a permanent Ceasefire Agreement in 2002 saw
 the emergence of the short-lived ‘New Aid Agenda’ which represented a clear
 vision and agreement between all donors that aid was to be leveraged towards
 influencing the Track 1 and Track 2 efforts .

 The 2003 Tokyo Donor’s Conference which saw aid pledges of up to 4.4 billion
 towards the reconstruction of the North and East, also saw a unanimous
 agreement towards operationsalising peace conditionalities, wherein it
 was stated that should the disbursement of the pledged aid would be conditional
 on the continuation of the peace process.
 Thus, while the Oslo Declaration which saw the LTTE and GoSL agree to a
 federal solution, was the high point of the peace negotiations, the Tokyo
 Conference represented a high-point of donor alignment on the Sri Lankan
 issue.

 Given the focus on peace-making during this period, most donor funded civil
 society activities focused on building a peace-consensus amongst local
 formal institutions and key political elite.
 What is significant is that while donors expected the civil society to
 all establish a popular mandate for the peace process, this mostly failed
 due to the selection of mostly urban civil society organisations that focused
 on either ethnic group, without addressing the rural base.

Just as the increase in intervention came as a result of domestic demand,
 the tapering of peace-negotiations and Western mediation was also the result
 of a change in domestic circumstances.
 From 2003 onwards, there was a distinct shift in the domestic perception
 of Western peace-making efforts.
 By early 2003, the LTTE had already jeopardised the possibility of a negotiated
 settlement to the conflict by announcing its intent to suspend the peace
 process on the grounds that donors had come to play favourites and had
 not treated the separatist organisation at par with the Sri Lankan government.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 On the other hand, there were differences within the Sri Lankan government
 regarding what an acceptable negotiated settlement to conflict should look
 like - while West-leaning Prime Minister Wickremsinghe strongly advocated
 the Western vision of a federal solution, Sri Lankan President Kumaratunga,
 under pressure from nationalist Sinhala allies continued to stress on a
 unitary state.

Following a break down of government, a fresh set of elections in April
 2004 saw the coming to power of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA),
 led by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
 The Alliance, which was primarily a coalition of nationalist parties that
 were against a divided state, had fought the elections in opposition to
 Wickremsinghe and his pro-West policy.
 Rajapaksa came to power through a political rhetoric that re-framed the
 ethnic conflict as a ‘ war against terror’, defending the constitutional
 status quo of the unitary state.
 Prima facie, it can be argued that these dynamics that led to a shift in
 domestic strategy away from Western peacebuilding was the consequence of
 elite instrumentalisation of local sentiments; that the rhetoric of Sinhala
 nationalism was the key cause for a change in government, has also been
 represented as a form of “ethnic outbidding” among the mainstream elite.

However, against a historical exploration of Sri Lanka’s political landscape
 since the time of independence, it can be seen that elite belonging to
 both these two dominant mainstream political parties - Sri Lanka Freedom
 Party (SLFP

), which opposed to Western intervention and the United National Party (UNP),
 whose leadership propagated the western liberal peace- have historically
 legitimized their rule with reference to themselves as heirs to the tradition

 A key feature of the political culture of modern Sri Lanka has been the
 agreement among national elites of the superiority of Sinhalese Buddhist
 claims to the island, with the core ideological difference being on how
 this can be achieved.
 In turns, political leaders from the SLP and UNP have remained committed
 to the consolidation of the Sri Lankan post-colonial state, only differing
 on the issue of the role that liberalisation and Westernisation must play
 in this process.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This is a function of the country’s demographic composition - at the time
 of independence in 1948, the Sinhalese were the largest ethnic group at
 74%, the Tamils composed 17%, while the Moors and Malays formed the remaining
 9% of the country's population.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "sabaratnam1987boundaries"

\end_inset

 During the course of the conflict, there has been a demographic change
 towards an increase in the proportion of the Sinahla’s to almost 80% of
 the island’s population.
 While it would be reductive to imply that the entire Sinhala population
 has reacted to this ethno-nationalistic rhetoric in the same fashion, the
 country’s primarily agrarian population has tended to vote in preference
 of its Sinhala identity.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 As several actors during the peace negotiations period pointed out, Wickremsing
he’s strategy of Western involvement was greatly determined by his need
 to create an “international safety net” against the possible return to
 conflict with the LTTE.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this has meant is, “Sri Lanka’s mainstream political actors have taken
 refuge in the affective, emotive but diffuse rhetoric of Sinhala nationalism,
 to the extent that nationalism has become a sine qua non of political survival
 articulated by all the mainstream.”

\end_inset

 At different points in history, elite from both these national parties
 along with other mainstream radical Sinhala dominated-political outfits,
 have mobilised the nationalistic rhetoric to “externalise” threats; till
 the 1980s, past targets had included foreign capital, MNCs, Indian intervention
 and IFIs.
 Interestingly, the first attempts towards a negotiated settlement were
 first initiated by the SLFP, led by Kumaratuga in the 1990s, Wickremeginhe
 and the UNP had only built upon this, rather than be the party that introduced
 the notion of a peaceful negotiated solution.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "rotberg1999sri"

\end_inset

 This tendency had led several political spectators to argue that at least
 on the surface, it appeared that the mainstream Sri Lankan elites had dropped
 the rhetoric of an explicit Sinhala nationalist solution, and had come
 to adopt a more moderate stand.
 For almost a decade nationalist discourses lost prominence among the mainstream
 parties and had been kept alive only by smaller, more radical groups, that
 were not necessarily a part of formal political processes.

\begin_layout Standard
In light of this, when exploring the re-emergence of Sinhala nationalism
 against the liberal peace project, it can be argued that while mainstream
 parties had begun to shift away from the ethno-national rhetoric, these
 dynamics continued to operate and emerged at the street level.
 During the initial phase of talks and the Ceasefire Agreement it is recognised
 that large parts of wider public opinion were divided between being optimistic
 or cautious about the process.

 In critiques of the peace-process, it is recognised that the lack of Track
 3 initiatives towards building an effective ground level consensus among
 “un-likeminded” local actors was one of the biggest fallacies on part of
 the peacebuilders.

 In the aftermath of the suspension of talks in April 2003, small nationalist-Ma
rxist and explicitly anti -Tamil groups like Janathi Vimukti Peramuna (JVP)
 leveraged this failure, to establish mass dissent among the majority Sinhala
 populace.
 While basing this mobilisation on the mass critique of the Western exercise
 and the associated Sri Lankan elite, these small local groups who had almost
 no formal institutional representation prior to this period, managed to
 widen their support base.
 Rampton highlights that in Sri Lanka, while elites have beem at the vanguard
 of nationalist mobilisation in the past, the aftermath of the peace-negotiation
s indicated that the populist effect of this nationalism had emerged and
 evolved beyond its elite genesis.

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the election victory, which is perceived as a successful nationalist
 mobilisation by Rajapaksa and the SLFP, in truth only signified Rajapaksa’s
 foresight in aligning himself to this local dissent and thus appropriating
 a nationalist mantel that had wide local legitimacy.
 The election alliance was also reliant on concessions to the nationalist
 grouping, who in turn were committed to reducing the influence of international
 actors and liberal NGOs in Sri Lanka.
 Therefore as opposed to being an elite formulated resistance to liberal
 peacebuilding, the coming into power of the Rajapaksa government can be
 considered as symbolic of a successful “local resistance” to the project.

\begin_layout Standard
Following the collapse of peace-negotiations, major Western donors are recognise
d as having returned to their pre-negotiations behaviour of being ‘political-str
ategic’ donors- while multilateral donors returned to working ‘around’ conflict,
 the US, UK and France, took to putting pressure on the new Rajpaksa government
 through diplomatic channels and international forums like the UN and the
 IMF, while minimally engaging with the conflict on the ground.

 In contrast, the ‘like-minded’ group of donors, shifted their peacebuilding
 focus back to targeting political change by facilitating domestic demand
 for governance reform through pressure from non-governmental actors ie
 local civil society organisations.
 From 2005 onwards, fifty percent to seventy per cent of aid to Sri Lanka
 from this group of donors, has bypassed the Sri Lankan government and has
 been delivered through non-governmental entities.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 During the peace negotiations period, these donors had worked in line with
 the New-Aid agenda and had perceptibly adopted a less reformatory stand
 when compared to the work on judicial reform and human rights that these
 donors had focused on in the 1990s.
 As a part of donor alignment strategy, with the focus on Track 1 and Track
 2 initiative, CSOs were only mobilised as a technical service delivery
 mechanism during this period.
 Particularly following the 2004 tsunami, while the Ceasefire Agreement
 was still formally in place, CLM donors had come to look to CSOa as a neutral
 humanitarian aid delivery system, even an alternative service delivery
 system to the government and the LTTE, and did not have any explicit peace
 or conflict related objectives.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "walton2008conflict"

\end_inset

 However, following the failure of the peace-process in 2005, CLM donors
 began a renewed push for foreign funded CSOs to take up ‘peace-initiatives’
 and influence the domestic political discourse which had increasingly come
 to adopt the newly elected Rajapaksa government’s framing of the ethnic-conflic
t as a ‘terrorism’ issue.

\begin_layout Standard
According to Walton, in terms of a definition, CLM donors in Sri Lanka identifie
d civil society actors based on a normative view of civil society as being
 the realm that is capable of building trust and cooperation, promoting
 and protecting rights and democracy by restraining an unruly state.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "walton2011balance"

\end_inset

 Walton highlights that this focus on the democratisation potential of the
 civil society alone, which continued in the post-war context, was inimical
 to the overall peacebuilding goal for two reasons - first, it caused CLM
 donors to overlook ‘unlike-minded’ organisations, which had immense mobilisatio
n potential and hold in society but were not necessarily committed to the
 Western model of democratisation and peace.
 Second, this conceptualisation of civil society is based on a rigid binary
 between the state and civil society, overlooking the fluid relationship
 between the two spheres; in Sri Lanka, the state has often appropriated
 initiatives of liberal‐minded civil society by mimicking their discourses
 or by establishing formal mechanisms for collaboration.
 As an indication of this, two of the largest and most active NGOs during
 the conflict and post-conflict period - Seva lanka and the Consortium of
 Humanitarian Agencies - have seen active participation by members of the
 Rajapaksa family on their boards.
 This fluidity draws from the nature of Sri Lankan politics, which is highly
 centralized and clientistic.
 This meant that the most effective CSOs were those that were directly supported
 by the government or political parties.

As has been discussed earlier, Rajapaksa’s coming to power on an ethno-nationali

; the most successful resistance was led by the JVP, which at its core,
 was a Leninist-marxist outfit that was primarily concerned with equitable
 social redistribution by a centralised state.
 JVP had emerged in 1965 as an off-shoot of the Maoist section of the Ceylon
 Communist Party.
 It principal constituency was based on subaltern, vernacular-educated youth
 in universities and the rural regions, against the marginalisation of vernacula
r “sons of the soil” by a post-colonial state that had been dominated by
 anglicised elite.
 Given that post-colonial Sri Lankan political culture had been characterised
 by the articulation of diverse demands from different political factions
 around an axis of nationalist authenticity, both elite and subaltern actors
 competed for the position as the true guardians of the nation and national
 interests.

Western liberal peacebuilders, through the Oslo Declaration of 2002 had
 indicated their vision that the a successful peace would mean a federal
 solution and a negotiated end to the conflict through a power sharing arrangeme
nt with the LTTE.
 Both mainstream national parties in Sri Lanka had also expressed commitment
 to this federal solution.
 This can be seen as the primary source of friction, when compared to the
 JVP and its collaborators view that this solution posed to Sri Lanka’s
 unitary state framework, territorial integrity and sovereignty.

 In light of the lack of discourse between the peacebuilders and these groups,
 the JVP thus took to ‘informal’ channels of opposition and mobilisation,
 using proxy CSOs like the Socialist Students Union and the Inter-University
 Students Federation (IUSF) to recruit youth cadres and forge an alliance
 among ‘alternative’ organisations were reflective of Buddhist religious
 nationalists causes.
 While most of these religious organisation were in the far-right of the
 ideological spectrum, they too rejected the notion of a negotiated settlement
 or a federal state structure.
 This is best represented by the JVP’s unlikely alliance with the JHU, an
 organisation that was formed by radical Buddhist clergy and had its base
 in urban and sub-urban aspiring vernacular elite.
 Unlike the JVP which had a more moderate stand in terms of the role of
 the ethnic minority and the need for secular ideals under a unitary state,
 the JHU has traditionally been blatant in its demands that the Sri Lankan
 state be a Buddhist majoritarian state, with express religious functions.
 Prior to its alliance with the JVP, the JHU’s primary line of attack was
 against the hegemonic “Christianisation” by Western intervention, as well
 local collaborators, who sought to undermine the agency and Buddhist identity
 of the Sri Lankan polity to determine its own national interests.
 Thus, by 2003, the sites of convergence for these two marginal groups was
 the understanding that Western intervention was hegemonic and threatened
 a unitary and territorially sovereign Sri Lankan state, under the ostensible
 threat by an illegitimate terrorist actor, the LTTE.

 The parliamentary elections of 2004 mark this turning point with the defeat
 of the ruling United National Party led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
 was defeated, by the United People's Freedom Alliance, which initially
 consisted of Rajapaksa’s SLFP and the JVP.
 There was further consolidation of power following the presidential elections
 of 2005, where Rajapaksa came into power as president primarily due to
 both JVP and JHU throwing weight behind his campaign.
 As a result, several spectators have argued that the present government’s
 strategy of no negotiation with the LTTE, the subsequent escalation of
 the conflict into a ‘War for Peace,’ and the post-conflict state strategy
 of state-led economic development reflect the aims articulated in the JVP
 and JHU agreements with the SLFP, as opposed to the SLFP, representative
 of the old elite, having developed these.
 This was also stressed upon by the 2007 ICG report which highlighted that,
 “ Nationalist parties, opposed to any significant devolution of power to
 Tamil areas of the north and east and to negotiations with the Tamil Tigers,
 help set President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s agenda.”

 Between 2005 to 2007 there was, what can only be described as, a systematic
 scapegoating of civil society initiatives that were linked to liberal peace
 work, based on these commitments that Rajapaksa’s SLFP made with these
 two organisations.
 The Parliamentary Select Committee on NGOs that was established in January
 2006 was chaired by JVP and dominated by JHU candidates; while focusing
 on discrepancies during the tsunami response, the body also actively interrogat

Through public hearings and an anti- NGO campaign in the state media, the
 JVP effectively linked civil society actions to notions of patriotism and
 support for a unitary state.
 There was also a class dimension to this backlash - since engagement with
 peacebuilders and Western donors required the ability to grasp technical
 English and the overarching liberal vision, the CSOs being targeted were
 large Colombo based organisations that represented a small elite network.
 Through the reliance on JVP and JHU for popular support, the UNFP led Rajapaksa
’s core constituency was among the lower class and rural Sinhalese, who
 came to equate the then term NGO with professionalised elite that were
 out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people.

 Thus, with peace being equated to an elite federal solution that was anti-patri

 to emerge as an alternative to Rajapksha’s ‘war for peace’ rhetoric was
 extremely limited.
 Most local NGOs and CSOs, in an attempt reinvent their presence in the
 domestic arena, disengaged from the usage of ‘peace’ terminology Finally,
 the establishment of a national ground level consensus towards pursuance
 of a victor’s peace, followed by an intense securitised developed to establish
 political legitimacy, is also recognised as having been a product of the
 work done by CSOs that have patronage of the JVP and JHU.
 Significant among these are the Patriotic National Movement, and the Manel
 Mal (Blue Lotus movement) which operated as patriotic welfare organisations,
 which on the surface worked to aid military families, but also provided
 a forum for the youth to engage in debates on nationalism and the need
 for military in the maintenance of a unitary state.

Thus, while the issue areas that these donors have focused on in terms of

 constant throughout their engagement in Sri Lanka, there have been distinct
 changes in the modalities for implementing peacebuilding strategies due
 to this local resistance.
 At an operational level, the idea of a “local rejection” brings into question
 the efficacy of civil peacebuilding in contexts with perceived “bad governance.”
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 As earlier discussed, there has been growing tendency for donors to bypass
 the government and directly engage with what their perceive as “civil”
 society as an alternative means of achieving liberal goals in contexts
 percieved to have ‘bad governance’.
 But as the Sri Lankan case demonstrates, the efficacy and sustainability
 of this strategy is questionable if “un-like minded” or “uncivil” factions
 have greater legitimacy among the masses.
 The vernacular local groups in Sri Lanka were successful in fanning mass
 anti-West sentiments against the liberal peacebuilding project by representing
 it as an elite, anglo-saxon, Christian mission that seeks to undermine
 national unity.
 During the pre-2000 period, most aid was channelled through the government
 and in the post-negotiations period donors had sought to channel aid being
 through the civil society, to ‘evade’ the perceived increase in illiberal
 governance by the new regime.
 However with the backlash and refusal of the local civil society to be
 associated with any peacebuilding work, this group of donors was forced
 to either taken on the role of implementers themselves, or have chosen
 to work only through INGOs and the UN system.

“Trapped between a rock and a hard place” : Peacebuilding in Post-conflict
 Sri lanka
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter focuses on the second type conditionality that has been imposed
 on liberal peacebuilders in the post-conflict period.
 A defining feature of the post-conflict environment has been the emergence
 of horizontal friction between the government and Sinhalese-nationalist
 local groups over the role of the West in the post-conflict reconstruction
 process; reflective of the feed-back loop model discussed by Björkdahl
 and Höglund , the same absolutist anti-West rhetoric that brought the governmen
t to power, became a point of contention and a source of friction.
 This has resulted in a power struggle between the dominant national political
 elite (Rajapkse) and dominant local Sinhalese-nationalist groups (JVP,
 JHU, Buddhist Sangha) to influence the masses and policy making through
 formal domestic forums like the electoral platform, and informal domestic
 platforms like the media.
 In the post-conflict period, the government successfully appropriated the
 nationalist mantle raised by local actors; the nature of the conflict's
 end as a ‘Victor’s Peace’ is recognised as being the catalyst that cemented
 asymmetrical horizontal or domestic power structures in Sri Lanka in favour
 of Rajapaksa, as it reaffirmed his conflict period election rhetoric of
 being the ‘saviour’ of the Sri Lankan state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most accounts have focused on the externalisation of threats by the
 regime in order to consolidate power, these represent static and structure-boun
d analyses that overlook the continued existence of ‘internal’ threats ;
 on conducting an actor-focused analysis as recommended by Björkdahl and
 Höglund, it can be said that while the ‘Tamil question’ was effectively
 put to rest by the military victory, the local rejectionist movements that
 were responsible for the public momentum and support for the military solution
 have continued to remain radical and against any power-sharing solution.
 The government on the other hand, has had to walk a tight-rope between
 these demands and international pressure, and has used its consolidation
 of power towards re-marginalising the political need for the JVP-JHU combine
 in its electoral victories.
 Second, it has used this control to construct what some authors have described
 as a ‘smokescreen,’ where international actors are involved in the rehabilitati
on and reconstruction of the country but within a specific framework.
 The need for developing this smokescreen in response to international pressure
 is also explored, as it further helps to understand the nature of controls
 that the government has developed to mediate Western participation in the
 post-conflict reconstruction process.

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate better the Rajapaksa administration’s establishment of centralised
 institutional conditions and controls on peacebuilders, which has effectively
 reduced their access to post-conflict contexts as well as the targeted
 population, this chapter concludes by focusing on the experience of the
 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

symbol "JPA"

\end_inset

nd the role of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) in “managing” peacebuilders.
 The institution of the PTF can be considered a source of the conditionality,
 while the JPA and other policies are instruments through which centralised
 domestic control is exercised.
 The efficacy of these two in crowding out CLM donors, as is reflected in
 the group's decision to disengage with the Sri Lankan context and peacbuilding
 processes, in turn reflects the outcomes of an effective appropriation
 of the “local turn,” and a co-option response by the national elite.
 The government has repeatedly invoked its legitimacy to impose these conditiona
lities through its electoral success among the masses.

 this friction, and the eventual response of elite-co-option.
 The second section looks at aspects of the long-standing vertical friction
 between the international community and the Rajapaksa administration regarding
 the trajectory of post-conflict reconstruction and settlement, and the
 national elite motivations which shaped a co-option response to this friction.
 The final part of this chapter focuses on instrumental role played by the
 Joint Plan of Assistance for the Northern Province (JPA) 2011-2012, and
 the role of the Presidential Task Force in implementing these conditionalities,

 This however, is arguably problematic given that since the end of the war,
 Sri Lanka has seen one presidential election, parliamentary election and
 a number of local elections, where these issues have repeatedly been brought
 up.
 What the experience of these elections has indicated is the successful
 statesmanship of Rajapaksa in being able to undermine an already decimated
 ill-prepared opposition through political strategising and incentives that
 encourages cross-over politics through a system of political patronage.
 Most importantly this has deterred the electoral choice of any effective
 opposition by Wickremasinghe’s UNP.

What has been a key cause for the lack of domestic momentum towards the

 While the Rajapaksa-led UPFA regime was immensely dependent on these local
 nationalist groups to consolidate its power in the period between 2005
 till the end of the war in 2009, in the post-conflict era there was a strategic
 need to re-frame the government’s position on multiple issues.
 The uneasiness with the extremist local agenda is most keenly noticeable
 in the experience of the presidentially appointed All Party Representative
 Committee and the Expert Panel on Constitutional Reform.
 The original intent of setting up both these ad-hoc bodies during the conflict
 was to signal a continued commitment to international concerns about a
 positive peace.
 However, neither process or body was able to implement intended peace-meal
 measures due to recurrent boycotts, walkouts, and protests by the participating
 JVP and JHU representatives.

 This strategy of Rajapaksa and the SLFP can be considered successful, as
 is indicated by the degree of success the President had in his re-election

 In the 2010 presidential election, that is estimated to have had a 70%
 voter turn out, the President won 58% of the votes.
 Subsequently, in an early parliamentary election in the same year, the
 SLFP and its allies secured a two-thirds majority in the parliament,, without
 support from either the JVP or the JHU.
 In fact, described as a ‘sordid alliance,’ the JVP instead chose to back
 the opposition party, the economic right leaning UNP (which had previously
 been headed by Wickremsinghe from 2000-2005), indicating the degree to

 Despite the anti-western rhetoric, the regime is unlikely (and unable)
 to disengage from ‘the West’decisively because there too many long standing
 economic, political and cultural linkages for Sri Lanka to entirely discount
 western views and sensibilities.
 Even towards the end of the war, the Rajapaksa administration had continued
 to attempt and establish some ground with Western actors.
 This is reflected in the discourse used by government to legitimize the

 With the transformation of the shadow war into a full-fledged of military

 Since the nature of engagement was based on political considerations, strategie
s changed in response to immediately perceived threats and opportunities.
 On one hand, this group of donors undertook a set of containment strategies
 that were based on the growing perception that the Sri Lankan state had
 increasingly come to take the side of more illiberal states in the global
 system.

At the same time, reflective of the pragmatism that motivates policy formulation
 within this donor group, from 2008 onwards, against the Rajapksha government’s
 declaration of ‘war for peace,’, there was also a systematic proscription
 of the LTTE in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.
 This led to the international de-legitimisation of the non-state actor,
 directly affecting sources of funding and the potency of diaspora pressure
 on international governments.
 In a sense, led by the US, there was a tacit acceptance of the ‘terrorism
 agenda’ put forward by the Rajapaksa government.
 Observers characterised this as a quid pro quo, wherein policy makers in
 these states felt that their hard-line stand on the LTTE would be reciprocated
 by the Rajapaksa government operationalising the long negotiated power

 Thus while nature and process of attaining the Victor’s Peace was problematic
 to the Western donor community, in its aftermath political-strategic donors
 viewed it as an opportunity to forge a more inclusive political settlement
 with more moderate Tamil sections in the North and East.
 In light of this tenuous window, the Rajapaksa government’s strategy of
 ‘externalising’ threats through an anti-West rhetoric was thus arguably
 tempered by the pragmatic need to continue to appease Western concerns,
 and thus shapes the co-option response.

The second set of economic considerations relates to the costs involved
 in the reconstruction process.
 Despite the prolonged conflict and the tsunami, the country was identified
 as a lower middle income state by 2009 – this was to have multiple impacts
 on the financing for the government’s intended path of state-led development
 as it meant that the country was no longer eligible for concessional loans
 from International Financial Institutions.
 In this context, the continued wielding of economic ‘sticks’ by more human-righ

 ability to finance a speedy reconstruction.

 In early 2010, following months of negotiations the EU had withdrawn the
 GSP+ privileges to Sri Lanka on the grounds that the key conditions for
 renewal ie respect of labour laws, working conditions in the manufacturing
 sectors and human rights, had not been met.
 As Goodhand notes, despite the government’s rhetoric that the GSP+ trade
 concessions were not important, there had been a number of informal discussion
 were the government had conceded to certain EU conditions about the plight
 of IDPs and political prisoners, before talks failed.

Also, despite the increasing focus on the Chinese role in financing Rajapaksa’s
 strategy of state-led development, several economists have pointed out
 that this financing is hurtful to the Sri Lankan economy.
 China does not distinguish between ODA from economic cooperation or investment
 and therefore there is a blurring of concessional finance with other financial
 flows.
 While the country has been among Sri Lanka’s largest source of foreign
 funding since 2009, most loans are non-concessional or in the form of export
 credit with high interest rates and strict commercial conditions being
 common.

 Additional typical conditions attached with Chinese loans of including

 Thus while the presence of China has been a source of political leverage

In the post-conflict period, the GoSL has thus followed a policy agenda
 geared towards selectively mobilizing domestic and international support,
 and balancing the two against one another.
 Goodhand et al.
 have described this as a strategy that consolidates the governments position
 through the, ‘construction of elaborate smokescreens seeking to capture
 or contain a range of potentially oppositional domestic and international
 forces.’

This has shaped the domestic institutional structures that took on the mantel
 of post-conflict reconstruction.
 In terms of their domestic orientation, in the vernacular press these instituti
ons have asserted their presence as being regulatory bodies that place a
 ‘check’ on any rogue activities by the UN system and the Western powers.In
 terms of their international orientation, there is a distinct two-fold
 strategy that has arguably been developed based on the nature and difference
 between the two groups of bilateral Western donors.
 Donor support by larger donors who are a part of the political-strategic
 group continues to be significant in the form of budget support from the
 IMF, helping bridge the external financial gap and encouraging private
 sector growth.
 Therefore, these external resources continue to have significant economic
 and political effects, and are differently treated.
 However, in the case of the CLM donors, who have been identified as a much
 smaller donors with no over commercial or strategic interests, the government
 views them as an externality that needs to be ‘dealt with.’

While focusing on locally imposed conditionalities in the post-conflict
 context, field research for this thesis primarily focused on the development,
 response and perceptions surrounding the PTF’s Joint Plan of Assistance
 for the Northern Province (JPA), launched in 2011.
 The field research was carried out for a period of three months in Colombo
 and Jaffna in early 2014, and focused on both the government and donors
 perception regarding post-conflict reconstruction, resettlement, and the
 role of the international community.
 Since the focus of the discussions was extremely sensitive and needed to
 be historically located, open ended and flexible interviews were conducted
 in order to delve into the issue and understand competing narratives, reflectio
ns, and perceptions.
 Finally, the interviews were conducted with highly placed officials in
 the government, the international donor and NGO community, and certain
 national NGOs who had participated in high level decision making during
 the peace-process and had continued to be active in the post-conflict context;
 since many of these individuals continue to work in the field, anonymity
 of sources has been of utmost significance.

There are two reasons that the JPA has been chosen in order to examine vertical
 donor-recipient peacebuilding friction in post-war Sri Lanka: First, the
 document represents the closest version of a consolidated government policy
 regarding its envisioned role for Western actors in the Northern Province
 since establishing absolute control over this contested region in 2009.
 The precursor to this can be found in the ambiguous Uthuru Wasanthaya (Northern
 Spring) Programme that was announced in 2009, before the end of the war
 and eventual consolidation of Rajapaksa’s stronghold in domestic politics.;
 the Uthuru Wasanthaya is however again recognised as a policy direction
 that reflects demands of the JVP and JHU, as opposed to reflecting the
 government's stand after having achieved its military victory.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The JPA thus has significant symbolic value as a GoSL led framework focused
 on ‘aligning’ Western aid with national priorities on the reconstruction
 and resettlement of the Northern Province, long considered the heartland
 of the Tamil minority, that directly impacts the ability of the Western
 nations to continue their post-conflict peacebuilding in the country.
 Second, asides from its symbolic positioning, the programme has an explicitly
 stated hierarchy which lists the envisioned role of Non-state actors like
 the UN and INGOs and the primacy of the government in collecting all end
 reporting and evaluation data.
 It was observed that from both, the perspective of the government and the
 Western donor community, the launch of the JPA was representative of two
 processes that emerged in the post-war environment- First, increasing centralis
ation of the Sri Lankan state based on which there was a growing move to
 ‘align’ aid to national priorities, by attempting to re-orient donor funding
 through the government; Second, the government's ‘divide and rule’ policy
 on Western donors.

In the aftermath of the War for Peace operations, characterised by the GoSL
 as the ‘Humanitarian Operation,’ which sought to liberate the North from
 the ‘terrorist’ LTTE, it was estimated that nearly 300,000 people had been
 displaced.
 Even before the official declaration of its victory on May 19th, 2009,
 on May 14, the official state media released a notice making clear the
 government’s intention that in the aftermath of the conflict, any rehabilitatio
n of the previously disputed regions would be controlled, led and implemented
 by the Central government, with special interest being taken by the President
 himself.

 Against the recurring criticisms from the international community and internati
onal staff in Sri Lanka of there having been rampant human rights violations
 and larger civilian casualties than reported by the government, the GoSL
 wanted to ensure that the rehabilitation of displaced persons was an entirely
 domestic process, in order to prevent any room for further criticism.
 The notice announced the appointment of a 19- member Presidential Task
 Force for Resettlement, Development and Security in the Northern Province
 (PTF), with the mandate to prepare strategic plans, programs and projects
 to resettle internally displaced persons and, rehabilitate and develop
 economic and social infrastructure of the Northern Province.
 There was no ambiguity with regards to what this meant for the peacebuilders,
 “When the PTF was established, they were made to know that this was the
 pivotal point, and they had to accept it...
 they had to fall in line with us.”

The Rajapaska government’s decision pursue a military solution from 2005
 onwards had meant an intense militarisation of Sri Lanka’s political and
 social arenas, that was accompanied by the valorisation of military personnel.
 Having placed the military and its defeat of the LTTE on a pedestal, the
 GoSL had increasingly presented the military establishment as being the
 repository of true nationalism, and thus, a central element in ‘re-assimilating
’ the North into the Sri Lankan nation state.
 The composition and modalities of the PTF reflects this executive-military
 nexus; President Rajapaksa nominated to the PTF Basil Rajapaksa, the President’
s brother who subsequently went on to become the Cabinet Minister for Economic
 Development, and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the then Secretary of Defence, indicating
 that the military would continue to play a key role in the re-emergence
 of the North.

Beginning with the 180-day Programme in mid-2009, the GoSL through the PTF
 established the initial protocol through which the UN, INGOs and NGOs could
 partner in rapid early recovery interventions to stabilize returning communitie

 It was mandated that the IDPs be kept in three rehabilitation camps until
 the PTF, along with the Army, felt that the region had been effectively
 stabilised.
 While the Government welcomed UN material assistance, it rejected the UN
 focus on principles regarding IDP returns and a political solution.

 The UN was largely unsuccessful in its plans to create a mechanism to coordinat

 In the absence of being able to obtain from the Government any sense of
 an overall public plan to guide post-conflict relief, recovery and reconstructi

 In contrast to the Sri Lankan government’s description of the camps as
 "welfare centres" or "welfare villages," critics, including the United
 Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay, described
 the camps as “prison” or "internment camps" given that the IDPs were not
 permitted leave the camps and there was limited access to the camps by
 independent aid organisations, independent media, relatives and politicians
 from domestic opposition parties.

 Thus, despite concerns among international actors that this prolonged detention
 was a ploy for further ‘cleansing’ and on the whole, went against international
 law, several INGOs and UN agencies eventually partnered with the government.
 As the 2010 Panel of Experts on accountability in Sri Lanka, in an additional

 “did not adequately invoke principles of human rights that are the foundation
 of the UN but appeared instead to do what was necessary to avoid confrontation

 The JPA 2011, according to government, indicated the end of the early recovery
 phase and the tapering off of the humanitarian crisis created in the aftermath
 of the Humanitarian Operation.
 While there would be an addressal of residual humanitarian need, thus real
 focus of the Joint Plan of Assistance to the Northern Province was to be
 on broader interventions in the post-conflict regions to strengthen market
 linkages and value-production to support the transition from aid reliance
 to self-reliance.
 Recognising the special needs of particularly vulnerable groups like households
 led by single women, separated children and unaccompanied minors, the elderly,
 disabled individuals and others and emergent social issues of land ownership,
 civil and legal documentation, and equal access to resources, the first
 JPA in 2011 was thus a humanitarian/early recovery funding appeal to donors
 for projects identified and approved by the PTF.

In terms of monitoring of progress and indicators, it was made clear that
 implementing partners would be expected to report twice a month on activities
 and their impact through the 3W (Who, What Where) tool, that would be controlle
d and managed by the PTF with the technical support provided by Office for
 the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
 The 3W tool had first been introduced by the OCHA following the Tsunami
 of 2004, and had been used by the agency to map out humanitarian responses
 and aid-disbursements during the crisis period.
 However, under the JPA, the OCHA’s role would be limited to providing,
 ‘technical support to develop the 3W database as per the Sri Lankan context
 and requirement as well as conducted training to all the staff of government
 and non-government agencies at central and field levels on reporting into
 the database.’28

 Subsequently, the JPA was renewed for the year 2012.
 Here, while re-emphasising the JPA as the primary domestic framework for
 early recovery, the drafters indicated that there JPA would also re-orient
 to focus on early development interventions, characterised as ‘soft assistance.’
 These were primarily to be capacity-building interventions by agencies
 which would be ‘led by respective GoSL authorities at every level.’

 However, like the earlier JPA and the nature of assistance allowed in the
 IDP camps, this would mostly be in the form of material assitance, through
 construction of facilities and supporting work done by government agencies,
 under the surveillance of the PTF.
 A major concession made to international staff working on projects in the
 North during this period, was allowing access to these regions without
 mandatory clearance from the PTF.
 According to the FTS, of the requested $147 million, only 40 million USD
 or 27.3% of the appeal was funded.

First, the CLM group of donors, including those whose donor agencies no
 longer have direct operations in Sri Lanka, had continued to fund conflict
 recovery related work in the country.
 Across both years, this group of countries collectively provided about
 40% of funding to Humanitarian projects being carried out by the UN, other
 than the direct programmes being implemented by their respective agencies
 and embassies.
 Second, in comparison, the response to the JPA from this group of donors
 has been, at best, lukewarm.
 Despite the fact that the JPA appeal was systematically launched two months
 before the OCHA appeal in order to strategically place it as the decisive
 humanitarian funding framework, the programme was under-funded, with CLM
 donors providing less than 20% of the whatever amount was finally given,
 as compared to political-strategic donors like the US, which was the largest
 JPA funder.

 The series of interviews conducted with donors agencies, embassies, and
 implementers thus sought to examine this response to the JPA, against the
 fact that even in the limited policy space that had existed immediately
 after the war, donors had continued to work towards building a civil peace,
 as detailed in the earlier section.
 The following sub-sections are reflective of the broad themes that emerged
 from these interviews.

Centralisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By both government and international accounts, the JPA was developed as
 a replacement to the Consolidated Humanitarian Action Plan (CHAP), which
 is an annual humanitarian appeals process that is traditionally hosted
 by the OCHA.
 Within this framework, the OCHA and UN system source aid from the international
 donor community and implement programmes through the UN system, also making
 the UN a focal point in the identification of roles and responsibilities,
 stating longer-term objectives and goals, and developing the framework
 for monitoring the strategy.

\end_inset

 In terms of the degree of consultation with the host government, the CHAP
 is to be approved by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and respective line ministrie
s, and does not necessarily have to be formulated with government participation;
 particularly during the conflict era, when humanitarian action spanned
 both government and LTTE controlled areas, humanitarian aid workers were
 more focused on being perceived as 'neutral,' which meant limited degree
 of government involvement.
 From the government’s perspective, the CHAP reflected an era when external
 ' LTTE sympathisers ' had aided the opposition, while in the present, it
 represented a parallel system of service delivery and thus needed to be
 better ‘aligned’ with national priorities.
 This undercurrent was evident during interviews with members of the government
 stating that the “CHAP was not discussed with the central government at
 all.”
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interview with member from PTF Secretariat, Colombo

\end_inset

 More grievously received was the UN Cluster system’s practice of bottom-up
 consultations to inform the humanitarian response; for the government,
 “consultations only took place at the district level, with Government Agents
 who do not have the authority or foresight.” 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interview with member from PTF Secretariat, Colombo 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Juxtaposed against this dominant line of institutional thinking, the replacement
 of the CHAP with the JPA led by the PTF represented the consolidation of
 control over alternative systems of foreign funding targeting post-conflict
 regions in Sri Lanka.
 The military defeat of the LTTE meant the end of a bifurcated aid system
 wherein ‘humanitarian’ aid was provided by non-government actors in the
 North, while development aid was provided by the government to the south.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "keen2009compromise"

\end_inset

 While the government goal has been to increasingly channel all aid through
 the government apparatus, the JPA represents a middle path wherein donor
 spending would take place within a government road-map.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the JPA signals that processes and priorities for early recovery,
 and eventually, development planning for in the post-conflict North would
 not be independent of the administration’s political stand.
 A repeated criticism made by the international community regarding the
 nature of post-conflict reconstruction by the GoSL was the lack of focus
 on ‘soft’ issues of reconciliation, inter-community dialogue and intra-communit
y coping in the post-conflict environment.
 Within the existing human-rights based approach that is privileged by the
 West and the UN, these issues are closely linked with the idea of transitional
 justice and accountability for war-time rights violations, without the
 resolution of which, effective transformation of underlying conflict structures
 and a durable peace are not possible.
 The JPA, as the key post-conflict planning framework makes no mention of
 these concerns, instead presenting a focus on ‘hardware’ issues as the
 programmatic template which draws from the ‘homegrown’ Sri Lankan model
 of reconciliation through development.
 In a separate key communication to donors from the Ministry of Economic
 Development, headed by Basil Rajapaksa emphasised, the Sri Lankan government
 equated effective reconciliation and settlement with the addressal of four
 key developmental challenges
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

- Restoring public goods such as health and educational facilities, restoring
 trade and livelihoods by ameliorating physical capital and communication,
 restoring key infrastructure and preventing exploitation and inequality
 of vulnerable groups.
 The JPA was thus designed as a first steps to the long term adressal of
 these challenges.
 To quote an interviewee who has previously been a presidential advisor,
 ‘ Basil is interested in winning hearts and minds through cement and steel.”

Third, the JPA re-asserts the Rajapaksa government’s depiction of centralised
 control over the rehabilitation of conflict affected regions as being key
 to the continued existence of an undivided unitary Sri Lanka state i.e the
 JPA as being central to national security.
 This is most significantly a salient response to repeated demands from
 international actors that the GoSL devolve power to the Northern and Eastern
 Province as a first step towards correcting the unequal power-sharing structure
s in the Sri Lankan state.
 During interviews with government representatives, it was indicated that
 the external demand for decreased centralisation was perceived as being
 seditious and contrary to the interests of a united Sri Lankan nation.

 Under the CHAP, it was felt that implementing agencies would allow the
 local government agents a greater degree of agency and decision-making
 authority that undermined the role of the central government and planning
 authorities, and reinforced regional identities.
 JPA activities on the other hand, would be carried out under the direct
 guidance of central government’s line ministries, with approval from the
 PTF and the responsible ministry heads.
 During interviews, an interesting insight that emerged was the idea that
 even in the case that Provincial Council for the North was elected in during
 the time of implementing the JPA, the control of reconstruction process
 would continue to be centralised.

 It was felt that devolution to any administrative unit other than the central
 government’s provincial agents would allow for fragmentation among the
 ranks, allowing regional politicians to ‘politically manipulate and may
 be overrun any development for personal gain.” Donors in turn discussed
 this as a personal strategy of the Rajapaksa clan to closely associate
 with all merits arising from the reconstruction process; as the shine from
 the Victor’s Peace wore away, it was hoped that the ‘big roads, infrastructure
 and the newly ‘Sri Lankanised’ North would bring in the votes.’

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of Björkdahl and Höglund’s framework, this centralisation of aid
 and external participation around the national government is an outcome
 of the ‘co-option’ response that the government successfully employed,
 which has allowed a small group of national elite to emerge as ‘translators’
 in any domestic dialogue with external actors.
 Here, the focus is not on the entire government or the legislative assembly,
 but the executive which is governed by Rajapaksa, his brothers, and a close
 circle of advisers.
 When tracing back the feed-back loop model to the circumstances that have
 been instrumental in centralising the power of mediating vertical frictions
 with external actors in this small group, it is possible to locate culpability
 in the narrow engagement of peacebuilders with the Sri Lankan civil society.
 While the overt scapegoating may have ended, the risk-aversion to stimulating
 domestic debate about the trajectory that this elite is taking, by social
 factions that are critical of the government, persists.
 Simply put, there has been a domestic lull and lack of momentum towards
 holding the government accountable from factions other than the JVP due
 to the systemic de-legitimisation of groups that endorsed power-sharing
 solutions in the conflict period.

Divide and Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As has been highlighted earlier, the GoSL’s co-option response to the vertical
 friction that emerged between it and external Western actors over the nature
 and direction of post-conflict reconstruction, was shaped by the economic
 concerns of the government.
 However, in this respect, the Rajapaksa administration has largely focused
 on courting larger political-strategic donors like the US, UK, Canada,
 Australia, and the EU, that posses definite potential in terms of expanding
 economic cooperation.
 In this respect as funding from the CLM group of donors has declined, both
 in absolute terms and in comparison to non-traditional donors, and given
 the lack of significant historical economic ties with these countries has
 meant that the GoSL has less incentive to encourage their presence in Sri
 Lanka.
 This, coupled with the fact that funding for more ‘political’ and sensitive
 sectors like civil society peacebuilding and human rights has come from
 this group, has led the GoSL to perceive them as a hindrance.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SriLankaSPA2011"

\end_inset

 Thus a key strategy adopted by the Rajapaksa administration as a part of
 its co-option response is to disincentivise any collective Western donor
 interaction with the government, a divide and rule strategy that is focused
 on preventing the re-emergence of powerful parallel donor forums that have
 collective bargaining power, as had existed during the peace-process and
 briefly during the tsunami response.
 Secretary to the Treasury, Dr.
 P.B Jayasundera, who has been a long standing member of Mahinda Rajapaksa’s
 inner circle, raised this issue as early as 2005, claiming that the “donors
 are likening themselves as a cartel,” and that, '' if the country is strong
 enough in its thinking, we should ask not just for a program loan or a
 balance of payment assistance but ' where are we heading?' ''

 Against this line of institutional thinking, in the post-conflict environment,
 the institution of the PTF can be visualised as the converging platform
 for the Ministry of Finance and Planning, Ministry of Economic and Urban
 Development and the Ministry of Defence, each of which is headed by either
 Mahinda Rajapaksa or his brothers.
 It represents a common liaison office for interacting with donors and in
 turn, determining the priority level of a donor in having a direct dialogue
 with either Ministry or the executive.

 Through interviews with the Development Partner’s Forum Secretariat, it
 became clear that the forum was more intended for de-facto organisation
 between external partners in the Sri Lankan context, rather than being
 a bargaining platform with the government.
 It was tacitly understood that the government preferred bilateral communication
, and according the the DPF Secretariat, it was increasingly difficult to
 establish contact or dialogue with Sri Lankan policy makers, despite the
 fact that at its conception, the Forum had visualised the regular participation
 of government officials.

 The Forum now presents as being an internal problem-solving forum for Western
 bilaterals and multi-laterals.
 Significantly, none of the non-traditional donors operational in Sri Lanka
 had a constant presence on the forum and not due to lack of invitation.

A second institutional practice that mirrors this intent of ‘divide and
 rule’ is the formal process of collaboration between the government and
 external actors.
 Donors that were interviewed confirmed that they either had signed direct
 bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) with the respective line ministrie
s in the period immediately before the PTF was operational, or had signed
 direct MoUs with the PTF.
 However, in both cases, the all reconstruction and rehabilitation work
 related permissions were cleared by the PTF, which worked closely with
 the Ministry of Defence.

 Given that the PTF is ultimately responsible to the President, who is also
 the head of the Ministry of Defence, it is felt that the entire process
 of donor fragmentation is closely based on the personal agenda of the Rajapaksa
 family first, and then to a much lesser degree with that of the UPFA coalition.
 Within this institutional structuring, and against the continued distrust
 and risk-aversion in the domestic civil-society, the CLM donors have taken
 to implementing all post-conflict related programmes either through their
 local staff agencies (eg.
 SDC, GIZ, NORAD) or through the UN system and INGOs.
 It was felt that in the case a local implementer was chosen, it would lead
 to additional scrutiny and bureaucratic procedures.
 However, in response, the government’s concern in controlling these control
 of INGOs and UN agencies, has become a key focus in the postwar.

Third, among CLM donors, there was also a distinct awareness that the treatment
 of political-strategic donors was markedly different, as the latter group
 was allowed many more opportunities to have a direct dialogue with the
 government.

 Through interviews, it was also felt that through the composition of the
 PTF, the president intended to send a less conspicuous message: Both Gotabaya
 and Basil Rajapaksa, respectively the Secretary of Defence and the Minister
 of Economic Development and Urban Planning, are US greencard holders, and
 their presence of on the PTF is intended to be both reassuring as well
 as assertive in ‘aligning’ these donors with larger disbursement pressures
 with the domestic agenda on reconstruction in the North, and the larger
 government economic agenda.
 This success of this is reflected again in the funding patterns of the
 JPA, where states from the Western political-strategic group has been the
 largest funders.

Thus, despite the failure of the JPA as programme, it can be argued that
 the government has been sufficiently successful in its larger goal of ‘squeezin
g out’ donors involved in peacebuilding through a process of establishing
 institutions and processes that encourage aid and donor fragmentation.
 It is however important to reiterate that the government did not cause
 this fragmentation, but merely effectively leveraged it towards creating
 greater operational differences between the political-strategic and ethical-pri
nciples (CLM) donors.
 Its co-option response where it presented its post-conflict agenda as being
 responsive to and derived from the international concern for human rights
 but through a domestic process thus effectively helped delay greater pressure
 from larger, more important donors.
 This left the smaller CLM donors to salvage a civil peacebuilding mission,
 without required backing, in a context that had become fundamentally opposed
 to the ‘Western’ tenants that the liberal peace, due to past over-sight
 of the peacebuilders.

Conclusion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five years after the end of the conflict in 2009, the most recent UN Human
 Rights Council Resolution 25/1 of March 28th 2014 which mandated the UNHRC
 to conduct an external international inquiry on the war crimes committed
 during the last legs of civil war in 2009, are indicative that the Western
 aims for a liberal peace in Sri Lanka are far from over.
 Significantly, one day after the Resolution being passed, the Sri Lankan
 polity in the Southern and Western Province were to vote for their provincial
 councils; in this highly charged environment, the opposition had keenly
 worked to leverage the upcoming Resolution vote against the ruling party.
 In light of this, the Rajapaksa led UPFA's winning both provincial councils
 with 55% of the vote share (the closest next competitors, the UNP, having
 secured only 26% of the votes in comparison) can be considered a confirmation
 that the local rejection of the larger liberal peace vision continues to
 exist at the very grass-roots.
 Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not mince words in his post-Provinci
al elections victory speech, declaring that, “ the victory is a fitting-reply
 to the anti-Sri Lankan elements..
 (it) is a clear mandate by the Sri Lankan people against the UN rights
 resolution threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
 country...”

This thesis, in discussing the failure of the more emancipatory and participator
y gradient of liberal peacebuilding, has sought to highlight how like every
 other external process, the process of building peace through a people
 is also mediated by the people.
 That in the case of post-conflict Sri Lanka, the majority has chosen to
 see Rajapaksa as their voice and primary mediator in this process, brings
 up the question of what respecting the local mandate implies in terms of
 externally influencing a move towards a more inclusive peace, that would
 take into account the concerns of the Tamil and other minorities.
 A concrete operational answer to this can unfortunately not be found in
 critical theory, which while engaging in a much needed discursive exercise
 of questioning the perverse assumptions and mis-perceptions that guide
 seemingly universalistic discourses, is still nascent in lending itself
 to pragmatic policy or practitioner oriented thinking.
 Significant frameworks that have been developed as alternatives to the
 existing ' problem-solving ' orientation of peacebuilding include advocating
 the framework of ' hybridity,' which recognises the heterogeneity of the
 local which lends to the legitimacy of formal and informal ' illiberal
 ' structures, and thus advocates an engagement with them to produce more
 locally relevant structures; the notion of the ' everyday peace ' which
 focuses on understanding what peace entails in informal spaces of social
 interaction, in order to enhance the social contract between externals
 and the local; and the lens of 'friction' that this thesis employed, which
 focuses on the points that mediation of the global discourse occurs, recognizin
g the inherently confrontational nature of any norm transfer.
 In common, these frameworks question the notion of the 'local,' advocating
 a larger role for the recipients in shaping and implementing a contextualised
 peace, in recognition that internationalism has real limits.
 But as more moderate critics like Roland Paris highlight, much of these
 seemingly anti-liberal but pro-peacebuilding positions draw from thinking
 in the liberal paradigm to support their alternatives, leading the moderates
 to assert that pragmatically, there may be ' no realistic alternative to
 some form of liberal peacebuilding strategy.

In terms of a stand in this large debate, this paper offers a focus on the
 issue of ' who ' from the international community builds peace and ' how,'
 to identify what an alternative if there is one - could entail.
 In Sri Lanka it must be stressed that while the initial local rejection
 stemmed from the faulty modalities of civil-peacebuilding, the spiral that
 ensued was compounded by the existence of a greatly divided international
 community, which the government further leveraged; thus, in discussing
 local rejection and a direction towards a realistic alternative, this paper
 would further like to raise the question of if the present failures occur
 not only on account of a disconnect in the theory of peacebuildings with
 existing realities, but also a disconnect among the actors who purportedly
 are unanimous in their interpretation and support for these different gradients.
 It would thus support the critical theory perspective for the need to begin
 by disaggregating peacebuildings, against a broader practitioner-based
 introspection of the context at hand, that more importantly, factors in
 the degree of agreement and priority given to the peacebuilding process
 by the different international actors involved in its implementation.
