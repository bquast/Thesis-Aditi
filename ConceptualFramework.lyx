\begin_layout Chapter
Conceptual Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter provides a conceptual discussion of the research topic by focusing
 on the specific form of peacebuilding that has been carried out by ethical-prin
cipled donors in Sri Lanka.
 It addresses the difference of this type of peacebuilding from typically
 cited cases of peacebuilding in Afghanistan and Iraq, as it has not involved
 any form of top-down nation-building or state-building in Sri Lanka.
 Thus, the usage of an umbrella term “peacebuilding,” to describe activities
 towards building different versions of a liberal peace in these different
 contexts would be confusing, and conceptually unsound.
 It then discusses the critical theorists’ critique of the emancipatory
 peacebuilding strand , as was operationalised in the Sri Lankan context,
 in order to examine flaws in the liberal peacebuilding model which overlooks
 the potential that ‘local agency’ and resistance has to destabilise a liberal
 peace.

Disaggregating peacebuilding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first institutional articulation of the peacebuilding discourse, which
 emerged following the end of the Cold War, can be traced to Boutros Boutros
 Ghali’s 1992 ‘An Agenda for Peace.’ In the report, the UN Secretary-General
 argued that there was a need to ‘identify and support structures which
 will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse
 into conflict.’

 The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 had saliently signaled the superiority
 of the liberal paradigm, and thus, in identifying intrastate conflicts
 as the most significant threat to the international order, this key document
 also located the solution within the liberal peace framework - it called
 for an expansion in the role of the international community from only containin
g conflicts (peacekeeping) to resolving conflicts (peacebuilding).

 Recurrently criticised as a ‘set of problem-solving strategies’ as opposed
 to a concretely developed framework, the term peacebuilding has come to
 be associated with a wide-range of interventions in conflict and post-conflict
 contexts.
 The proliferation of activities and strategies has meant that the term
 is less concerned with ‘how’ to achieve peace, as opposed to what this
 peace must look like.

 As a result, peacebuilding has come to be associated with the end ideal
 that the economic and political reforms it endorses seek to achieve - to
 build peace within and between states through the promotion of liberal
 democracy and market economics.
 The theoretical underpinning of liberal peacebuilding project is the notion
 of liberal peace.
 According to this, democracies based on the rule of law are less likely
 to go to war due to domestic institutional constraints upon leaders, and
 due to the economic interdependence that arises out of pursuing market
 economics globally.

Goodhand’s distinction between the different types of donors based on the
 conflict sensitivity of their aid marks a break from earlier literature
 that focused on variation in institutional behaviour between donors, as
 these typically discussed the issue within the traditional scope of development
 aid as aid in a non-conflict environment.

 Within this scope, conflict situations are viewed as areas of operation
 for humanitarian aid alone, as was the dominant practice till the end of
 the Cold War.
 The peacebuilding discourse, in this sense, marks a new orientation for
 development aid in conflict and post-conflict contexts.
 It was developed with the intention of establishing continuities between
 humanitarian and development aid, while attempting to harness the potential
 of development aid in conflict resolution and transformation processes.

One part of critical theory on peacebuilding, in the exercise of critiquing
 the seeming homogeneity of the discouse and to outline the inherent tensions
 in conceptualisation and implementation of the project, has identified
 that there are four distinct interrelated strands of liberal peace and
 hence, multiple ‘peacebuildings.’ Oliver Richmond and John Heathershaw argue,
 that these differences and contentions are obscured in mainstream policy
 discourse in order to create a seemingly cohesive meta-narrative, where
 peacebuilding is more ‘described than defined,’ as a set of problem-solving
 strategies that are universal.

 Each of these different versions of peace reflect the four intellectual
 strands about the possible ontology of the liberal peace- the ‘victor’s
 peace’, the ‘institutional peace’, the ‘constitutional peace’ and the ‘civil
 peace,’.
 The victor’s peace reflects the age-old realist argument that a peace that
 rests on a military victory and upon the hegemony of a victor is more likely
 to survive.
 The institutional peace rests upon attempts to anchor states within a normative
 and legal context in which states multilaterally agree how to behave and
 how to enforce or determine their behaviour, reflecting an idealist, liberal-in
ternationalist vision.
 The constitutional peace develops from the liberal Kantian argument that
 peace can only be developed through democracy, free trade and the prevalence
 of cosmopolitan values.
 The final identifiable strand is that of the civil peace.
 It draws from the sphere of direct action and democracy, towards the attainment
 of democratic governance and basic rights.

The first gradient of peacebuilding, which privileges the development of
 democratic systems in post-conflict contexts, was mainstreamed into global
 policy discourse and practice by the UN under Boutros Boutors Ghali, and
 later Kofi Annan, against the rekindling of liberal internationalist ideals
 in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse.
 First operationalised following the Balkan Crisis, democratic peacebuilding
 subsumed under it the concepts of peacemaking, and peace-enforcement along
 with the traditional peacekeeping role that the UN system had carried out
 during the Cold War.
 The emergence of the peacebuilding discourse intimately linked with reconceptua
lisation of notions of state sovereignty.
 During the Cold War, International interventions had been underscored by
 a Westphalian notion of the state, wherein the desire to endorse the pursuit
 of liberalism and democracy took place against the recognized precedence
 of territorial and political sovereignty.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 The end of the Cold War marked a transition to a post-Westphalian conception
 of sovereignty that inextricably linked peace within states to peace between
 states, with a liberal system of economic and political structuring being
 advocated as the ideal form of sovereign governance.
 The underlying rationale was that liberal democratic states, through increasing
 trade relations and economic integration along with an open political culture,
 are most likely to make decisions that are mutually beneficial.
 As argued by former US President Clinton, ‘democracies don’t attack each
 other, ’ drawing from which, ‘the best strategy to insure our security
 and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy everywhere’.

 Reflective of this, the Agenda of Peace suggested a wide range of post-conflict
 interventions that included the monitoring of elections, reform of governmental
 structures, and the promotion of political participation.

Against the experience of democratic peacebuilding experiments in Cambodia,
 Latin America and Kosovo, it became clear that the nature of ‘peace as
 order’ was not entirely consensual, as its creation often hinged on a condition
al relationship between peacebuilding agents and recipients.

 Identified as a ‘conservative’ model of peacebuilding, the process of democrati
c norm diffusion in post-conflict societies took place through an enforced
 norm transfer.
 Initially, this ‘enforcement’ entailed a carrot and stick process of allocating
 benefits or punitive measures to the reforming country by the multilateral
 liberal system.
 However soon, in the highly charged security environment in the aftermath
 of the 9/11, there was emerged a consensus among a small group of Western
 states on the use of physical force in order to enforce these norms.
 While the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq represent the extreme extent of
 this shift, moderate versions of interventions guided by the ‘peace as
 order’ vision have taken the form of conflict-management, and can be seen
 in Mali, The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola; in the latter
 set of cases, the ‘host’ state continues to have some say in the kind of
 order that is to be established.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "newman2009new"

\end_inset

 The key difference between peace as conflict management and peace as order
 has also been the point of intervention - in the latter conceptualisation,
 described as ‘hyper-conservative’ peacebuilding, interventions are pre-emptivel
y undertaken in contexts that are considered prone to conflict due to the
 existence of illiberal governance systems and a consequent lack of basic
 security.
 The key target of ‘peace as order’ is thus, the failed state, which to
 peacebuilders , is representative of anarchy that has the potential to
 destabilise the international system , allowing for the repositioning of
 peacebuilding as state-building.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "newman2009new"

\end_inset

 At the very core of this notion is the need for a militarily imposed settlement
 in order to reconfigure who has the monopoly over force in the identified
 ‘failed’ state.
 This established basic security as an a priori condition to any form of
 successful domestic and international institutional development of a democratic
 peaceful order.
 As Krause and Jutersonke note, a key feature in the formulation of peacebuildin
g as state-building processes is the institutional linking of security with
 development and development aid by donors.
 Through the Cold War Era, within Western states, these had been separately
 pursued by parallel institutional and political structures.

 Following 9/11, development aid has become an explicit instrument in the
 stabilisation and state-building agenda that certain Western actors undertook
 under the umbrella of ‘War on Terror.’ The clearest indication of this blurring
 between the two spheres, leading to the ‘securitisation of development’
 is the emergence of aid practices that purely lend to the military rationale
 of these operations, and are often disbursed in coordination with military
 authorities.

Heathershaw argues that while the emergence of the peacebuilding as state-buildi
ng discourse has emerged to be the dominant focus of policy, academic and
 popular literature in the last decade, the tendencies toward this can be
 traced from the early 1990s.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Academics like Helman, Rathner and Zartman used ideas of ‘failing’ or ‘collapsi
ng state’ when discussing the increase of civil wars in Africa, while the
 CIA funded a wide scope research programme called the State Failure Task
 Force.
 But the possible main-streaming of military interventions during the mid
 1990s faced an insurmountable roadblock in the form of high-profile failures
 of state-centric peacebuilding projects in Somalia and Rwanda.
 The potential centralisation around the ‘state failure’ agenda was thus
 delayed by a shift in focus to ‘people centric’ peacebuilding, against
 a call for new approached that moved away from the state, and adopted a
 more consensual peacebuilding practices that built peace from the grassroots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During this period, against the mass backlash against top-down peacebuilding,
 which was criticised as hegemonic and neo-imperial, donors and the peacebuildin
g community sought to move towards a more measured approach that equally
 divided risks and dividends between the peacebuilders and recipients.
 Based on a broad conflict transformation model which recognised the interaction
 of social, political and economic factors and inequalities in creating
 and perpetuating conflict, peace was reconceptualised as social justice.
 Peacebuilding was then presented as a form of custodianship, wherein through
 a combination of consent, inducement and occasional coercion, peace as
 justice can be achieved through facilitating the acceptance of difference
 and otherness, as well as the institutionalisation of social justice.

As Richmond discusses, the pursuance of civil peace is an anomaly in thinking
 about liberal peace, because the state is not envisioned as the site of
 transformation.
 It instead privileges individual agency as a means to achieve human security
 and justice, beyond the state system, and was seen as the ‘emancipatory’
 version of liberal peace.

 The incorporation of civil society in peacebuilding interventions can also
 be discussed as a more invasive peacebuilding.

First, the positioning and access of CSOs made possible more intimate forms
 of norm dissemination, helping construct a ‘peacebuilding consensus’ among
 the masses.
 Second, in states which were perceived to be ‘difficult’ or ‘inadequate’
 in cooperating with the international community, funding agencies positioned
 CSOs as an ancillary form of governmental authority.

 Richmond highlights this emancipatory civil society-led peacebuilding is
 typically carried out in contexts where the primary ‘peacebuilders’ are
 donor agencies, without the prioritisation of negotiations in the state-centric
 arena; specifically the group of small donors or the ‘like-minded’ states,
 who prioritise the effective achievement of aid project goals, privilege
 the emancipatory version of peacebuilding.
 The centrality and application of this gradient of peacebuilding led by
 aid agencies or donors is distinctly different from more orthodox forms
 of peacebuilding, where civil society peacebuilding is preceded by military
 interventions as has increasingly become the norm.

Critical theorists argue that in the last decade, as evidenced by the institutio
nalisation of concepts like the ‘Responsibility to Protect,’ proponents
 of peacebuilding as state-building have attempted to present civil peacebuildin
g as a part or a stage in the larger state-building process, associating
 civil society activism with basic security.
 In an attempt to present a cohesive narrative in the form of a universal
 ‘peacebuilding consensus’, these different gradients of peacebuilding may
 often by combined and thus, in any one peacebuilding intervention, these
 different strategies may be employed at different points; this chronology
 and degree to which a gradient is privileged depends on priorities associated
 with dominant state interests, donor interests and the capacity of peacebuildin
g actors.

 In light of this, the biggest criticism against the homogenisation of these
 different discourses and modes of operation is that this process may well
 limit the ability of implementer to take into account operational realities;
 conservative, orthodox, and emancipatory versions of the liberal peace
 may actually contradict and undermine each other, leading to disruption
 in the broader peacebuilding process.

Questioning an ‘emancipatory’ liberal peacebuilding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases like Sri Lanka, which represent a conflict and post-conflict context
 where there government can competently provide basic security and where
 there are ostensibly functional democratic practices, the emancipatory
 gradient presents with the only course of peacebuilding intervention.
 As a result of this, emancipatory peace-builders in these contexts face
 radically different challenges than state-builders, who have the sanction
 of force.
 Led by donors and aid agencies, the operationalising of emancipatory peacebuild
ing in such contexts is motivated by larger concerns in the aid community-
 first, for the sake of the ethics and legitimacy of the peacebuilding project,
 and second, the search for efficiency and sustainability.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Principles of donor engagement based on there two concerns, that are considered
 mutually reinforcing, were developed in a operational scope that is much
 broader than peacebuilding.
 These principles originally developed with a focus on non-conflict contexts,
 but have also come to guide donor-led peacebuilding interventions .
 This has been stressed on by the 2008 Accra Declaration which states that,
 “aid effectiveness principles apply equally to development co-operation
 in situations of fragility, including countries emerging from conflict,
 but that these principles need to be adapted to environments of weak ownership
 and capacity.”

 The general thrust of most principles guiding the aid architecture has
 been that ethical and legitimate donor interventions are more likely to
 produce more effective and sustainable results; In this respect, the idea
 of ‘local ownership’ or ‘community led’ interventions has come to become
 a commonly shared buzz-word between the aid and peacebuilding worlds.

‘local ownership’ as a source of legitimacy and effectiveness in non-conflict
 contexts has been a key concern for traditional bilateral donors since
 the early 1990s.
 It was formally recognized as a key concern for development aid in 1996,
 with the OECDs Development and Assistance Committee (DAC) which called
 for a comprehensive approach that ―respects local ownership of the development
 processes (DAC, 1996: 9).

However, despite the seemingly more consensual of intervention reflected
 in the emancipatory version of peacebuilding, critical theorists are equally
 skeptical of its ‘emancipatory’ potential, as they are of the more orthodox
 gradients, arguing that it takes places within the limited space that the
 neo-liberal paradigm will allow.
 The failure of the different peacebuildings is thus, ‘ not because of the
 efficiency problems related to the technicalities of its workings, but
 in the problematique [sic] assumptions and contradictions within the model
 itself ...’

 The emancipatory gradient continues to be based on the machine-like workings
 and faith-based assumptions of liberal peace, attempting to technically
 addressing contextual problems with universal answers, in the process,
 denying the local constituencies’ right of being an organic part of their
 own peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linear framing of international intervention in the cause of peace has
 an implicit liberal telos.
 For the achievement of this telos, the role of emancipatory peacebuilding
 can be understood as the removal of blockages by entrenched power elites
 by freeing the local agency of civil society, which, it is assumed, would
 undoubtedly express their support for universal liberal democratic norms.
 It thus constructs a dichotomy between those doing the peacebuilding interventi
on, and those for whom the intervention is designed.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "chandler2013peacebuilding"

\end_inset

 Within this imagery, the ‘local’ is understood as lacking agency and mobility,
 and post-conflict spaces are conceptualised as empty spaces in need of
 new norms, governing institutions and patterns.
 Further, liberal peacebuilding relies on a form of civil society that is
 relatively free of ethno-nationalism and generally oriented towards liberal
 norms and values, in other words, mirrors the Western model.
 As a result, it overlooks a range of other ‘un-like minded’ actors that
 play a key role in mobilising social attitudes and sentiments.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Certain scholars have described this as a “romanticising of the local,”
 wherein liberal peacebuilders are unable to constructively engage with
 local agencies and processes due to their specific normative understanding
 of what compromises the ' local ' to be engaged with.
 It thus overlooks the possibility that the emergence of local agencies
 could mean a resistance to the ‘emancipatory project’ of liberal peace
 builders, which may lead to claims of autonomy from the regional and internatio
nal sphere and the intended end vision.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that aid or funding the key instrument for mobilising peacebuilding
 activities in conflict, in peacebuilding contexts like Sri Lanka, international
s are increasingly realising that this local resistance is reflected in
 the reverse imposition of conditionalities to their aid.
 As Richmond notes, ‘internationals are now learning that where they set
 conditionalities so local actors also expect conditionalities to be observed.
 Furthermore, local actors are becoming adept at manipulating conditionalities
 in their favour.
 If a sustainable peace is to be constructed, there can be no exit until
 both locals and internationals have agreed that such a version of peace
 has actually been achieved.”

Thus while emancipatory liberal peacebuilding has coalesced around idea
 of local ownership, civil society or capacity-building approaches, implying
 an acknowledgement of concerned power relations between the local and the
 international, it is a selective acknowledgment that fails to recognise
 the potential for local agency and resistance.
 What this implies at an operational level is that peacebuilders choose
 to view any form of resistance as ‘non-compliance,’ or in the language
 of peacekeeping, as “spoilers” that are to be mitigated rather than engaged
 with, as a result of which, the final consensus is as artificial as top-down
 models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drawing from this, critical theorists have called for a ‘local turn’ in
 peacebuilding, that eschews the normative liberal ideal and instead adopt
 a pluralist view of difference, conceptualising peace as hybrid, multiple
 and often agonitic.
 The ‘local turn’ thus implies an engagement with the critical and resistant
 local agencies that have a role in shaping a subaltern view of peace, and
 how they act to engage with different conflict related social dynamics
 and the structures that maintain them.
 Drawing from the post-structuralist writings on resistance to structural
 domination, the notion of a “local turn” implies that agency can only really
 be exerted politically through public mobilization on a large scale.
 This collective agency emerges through forms of hidden, everyday resistance,
 in the engagement with structural power.
 They are discussed as being “hidden” because they operate at a level where
 they may be invisible to formal theory and methodologies, and those that
 operate based on these.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Critically, local agency is not a “new” phenomenon and has always been
 present in different forms.
 It is the present crisis of the liberal peace, along with the growing number
 of researchers from the “sub-altern” ranks, that has enabled academia to
 “see” the local and bring into focus how legitimacy can be collectively
 constructed by the different elements of the local, and in the case of
 Sri Lanka, by dominant elements that were fundamentally against any liberal
 peacebuilding.

Analytical framework : Friction in Global-Local Encounters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Informed by the critique of different strands of peacebuilding, there has
 been a growing body of work led by peacebuilding practitioners as well
 as academics focused on main-streaming academic thinking into policy debates
 that have adapted this theoretical idea of a ‘local turn’ towards developing
 analytical frameworks for assessing post-conflict environments and peacebuildin
g.
 Björkdahl and Höglund have attempted to further refine the theory of a
 ‘local turn,’ and develop the idea of ‘friction’ as a conceptual lens through
 which conflictual engagements between global and local ideas, actors and
 practices in peacebuilding can be identiﬁed and analysed.
 The notion of ‘friction’ is based on the recognition that the constructed
 dichotomy between those doing the peacebuilding, and those for whom the
 intervention is designed is a false separation; global– local interactions
 are identified as being encounters that ‘can be both a site for empowerment
 and for domination.’

 Drawing from the post-modernist thought, its analytical lens of perceiving
 all interactions in terms of the exercise of power and resistance to this
 power, ‘friction’ with respect to the peacebuilding paradigm refers to
 the evolving confrontations that necessarily emerge when external actors,
 discourses, and practices interact with the local counterparts at peacebuilding
 sites.

 Peacebuilders tend to overestimate the attractiveness of the normative
 package inherent in the liberal peace while under-estimating the power
 of local agencies to resist and transform their project.
 In this context, friction can be understood as the process which is triggered
 by conflictual encounters and then gives rise to other outcomes, rather
 than being an outcome to study itself.
 Björkdahl and Höglund equate the notion of friction to concepts like localisati
on, vernaculisation and hybridisation, which in common indicate the agency
 of the recipient to mold and influence the direction of an externally introduce
d idea.
 The added value that this brings to the analysis of peacebuilding encounters
 is the recognition that while any encounter will result is some sort of
 friction, dependent on the ability of actors to negotiate these, the outcome
 can be oppositional but also accommodating, or selectively accommodating.
 Thus the idea of friction in peacebuilding encounters refers to, “ an uneven,
 unexpected and uncertain process in which global and local confluence to
 mediate and negotiate difference and afﬁnity.
 Friction thus tends to change facts on the ground as it creates new and
 messy dynamics, agencies, and structures as well as unexpected coalitions
 built on ‘awkwardly linked incompatibles’ based on either universal or
 particular ideas.”

 Thus, while in cases like Sri Lanka, this friction has led to perverse
 outcomes by valourising local actors against ideas of power-sharing, in
 other contexts it may well encourage greater democraticastion.

An important component of this framework is the recognising the multi-layered
 nature of power contests.
 Peacebuilding interactions can see the emergence of vertical frictions,
 that results in asymmetrical relations between the international and the
 local.
 But there is also the issue of horizontal frictions, wherein these interactions
 impact the relationships between different ‘domestic,’ or ‘local’ actors
 or between the external global actors, in the post-conflict landscape This
 implies that there is a potential that in the local, there are different
 perceptions about the peacebuilding process as a result of which a first
 contest may very well take place between local factions, the result of
 which then impacts what course the vertical friction will take.
 As a recognition that there is a multiplicity in terms of power structures
 that determine the eventual outcomes, the analytical point of departure
 is to use an actor-oriented perspective to identify the points at which
 this mediation or negotiation occurs, and thus involves moving beyond the
 broad categories of ‘conﬂict between the local and the global.’ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Björkdahl and Höglund use the concept of friction to identify different
 categories of responses in terms of compliance, adoption, adaption, resistance,
 co-optation and rejection .
 A response of compliance by local actors results in a forced adherence
 or submission to global external discourses.
 An adoption response refers to the local adoption of global norms.
 An adaptation response refers to the hybridisation of global norms and
 practices with local characteristics.
 A co-option response is largely led by the local elite and sees the strategic
 adoption of external norms and practices as a means of averting pressure.
 The resistance response sees a dominance of global characteristics and
 a limited adoption of external norms.
 Finally, the rejection response refers to the complete exclusion of global
 practices from the local.
 These responses create new realities as they alter power relations, transform
 agency and mediate practices related to peacebuilding.
 The new realities, which emerge from these encounters, will in turn create
 feedback loops which may create new encounters.

 As an example of a feedback loop, the intensification of Sinhala nationalistic
 fervour among the masses, which is reflective of relective friction between
 ‘local’ actors and peacebuilders, was responsible for bring into power
 the Rajapaksa led United National Freedom Party (UNFP), whose election
 rhetoric was a decisive no-negotiate policy with regards to the LTTE.
 This effectively altered the local realities and signaled new conditions
 for the next stage of interactions and the potential directions any vertical
 friction would go.

Björkdahl and Höglund have used this framework in Sri Lanka order to conduct
 a short-term analysis, which focuses on the dynamics that exist and emerged
 due to demands for transnational justice.
 There however continues to be a need to analyse friction in the context
 of peacebuilding efforts in Sri Lanka from a the long-term perspective.
 This requires an analysis of the feedback loops created by long-term engagement
 and discussing how the resulting outcomes bring into existence new and
 unexpected arrangements.

Research Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an explanation to why the coalition of like-minded donors rapidly reduced
 peacebuilding interventions in the Sri Lankan post-conflict context despite
 the seemingly less-confrontational nature of their project, this thesis
 examines the factors and dynamics that demonstrate the primacy of local
 actors and their agency in ‘allowing’ any form of external peacebuilding
 .
 As discussed by Berdal, ' the unfortunate consequence of conceptually abstracti
ng peacebuilding is that these operations do not adequately leverage local
 knowledge or appreciate how past experiences set limits on what outsiders
 can achieve.'
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Thus, this thesis has a two fold focus – first, to disaggregate the discourse
 on peacebuilding and locate the Sri Lankan case within a specific gradient
 of peacebuilding, against existing documentation on the trajectory and
 trends of Western peacebuilding engagement.
 Second, to examine the process by which local challenges to peacebuilders
 emerged and limited peacebuilding in the post-conflict context.
 These foci require an engagement with both the theory and practice of peacebuil
ding in Sri Lanka, and thus three methods have been used in order to develop
 this research- desk literature reviews of academic studies as well as practitio
ner papers, primary unstructured interviews and content analysis of government
 documents and state media reports from 2009 onwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central methodological approach of this thesis is the case study approach,
 where the objective is to delve into cases in support or against an existing
 theoretical proposition.
 In political science, there is a rich history of case study research in
 public administration and public policy studies, as well as a vibrant contempor
ary methodological discussion within comparative studies of political system.
 Yanow et al detail that while “the case study” has been recognised as the
 most common method of analysis in political science, the term has been
 used to refer to a range of meanings and usages that vary from specific
 methods to a research approach.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 They detail that, “those advancing “case study” as a set of methods --
 the predominant meaning -- engage the concept as a specific form of research
 involving multi-site studies aimed at establishing causal inferences and
 hypothesis-testing.
 Those taking the second perspective typically treat “case study” as part
 of a broader methodology that emphasizes human meaning and reflexivity.
 These scholars more often engage in single-site research aimed at detailing
 the lived experiences of persons in that setting.”
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 These two perspectives attach a different importance on case study methodology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is reflective of the latter tradition of ‘single-site’ case
 studies, where the nature of analysis is is inductive and human-centered.
 The focus is to learn about the potentially multiple social realities that
 characterize the setting and its actors.
 Yanow et al discuss that field research-based case studies engage in an
 ethnographic version of observation wherein the number of “observations”
 ie number of interviews, interactions and examinations of documents and
 data – does not have the same boundaries as number of locations in which
 the case study is carried out.
 Thus, field research generates a wide rage of qualitative-interpretive,
 within-case “observations” that reflect patterns social relations, routines,
 organisational behaviours, actions, and so on.
 In contrast, multi-site case study analysis, which is privileged by the
 comparative politics sub-field, draws upon case studies to explore human
 diversity with the intent of using these to establish general propositions
 about human conditions and interactions.
 However, since the aim of multiple-site case study analysis is to present
 and test generalisations, nuances, and specific dynamics are often glossed
 over in order to focus on commonalities across cases.
 In other words, “ the focus on law-like generalizations that this entails
 runs counter to a more interpretive approach that focuses, instead, on
 verstehen, thick description, reflexivity, and other such elements for
 establishing the trustworthiness of the research.”

In order to addresses the first question regarding the nature of peacebuilding
 in Sri Lanka and the motivations and modalities of this process, the thesis
 draws from the critical theory typology of peacebuilding and the critiques
 that explore emancipatory peacebuilding specifically, as discussed in the
 earlier sections.
 The analysis for this question has thus largely been informed through a
 literature review on peacebuilding and the specific experience of peacebuilding
 in Sri Lanka.
 This was then located within the larger body of research that already exists
 on Sri Lanka, in order to further build on already existing insights on
 the challenges that the CLM donors and supporters of peacebuilding have
 had in engaging with a post-conflict state like Sri Lanka.
 An exploration of the history of peacebuilding during the conflict has
 been crucial in helping construct what the present government administration’s
 approach to CLM donors has been 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to explore local challenges to and conditionality on external peacebuil
ders, the assertions made by non-mainstream political groups from early
 2003 onwards has been marked as the starting point of analysis.
 The employment of Björkdahl and Höglund framework of identifying frictions
 and the power relations that influence the eventual response to this frictions,
 has been the primary conceptual tool for analysing the nature of local
 resistance against devolution of powers in the during the conflict and
 post-conflict periods, and later, the emergence of government imposed condition
s.
 The latter set of conditionalities have been motivated by the need to balance
 appease these local reactions, against macro political considerations of
 positioning Sri Lanka as a democratic state.
 The process of identifying the different types of frictions and their point
 of emergence has, in turn, been informed by a literature review and through
 fieldwork that was carried out over a period of three months from January
 to late March 2014.
 A majority of interviews with national NGOs, think tanks and government
 officials took place in Colombo.
 Interviews with donors took place in Colombo, Geneva and in Jaffna, to
 examine the implementation of peacebuilding on the ground by donor agencies.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ethical Considerations in Designing Research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it has been five years since the end of the Sri Lankan conflict, fieldwork
 or research on issues that are considered ‘sensitive,’ particularly in
 light of the increasing Western pressure on the government, has meant that
 it continues to be a potentially dangerous setting for external researchers.
 The agents of peacebuilding, donors and INGOs, who continue to face daily
 challenges in their domestic interactions toward shaping the post-conflict
 environment are unlikely to provide information that will put their organisatio
n in an unfavourable light.
 Thus, while interviews with donors, senior government staff, INGOs and
 the UN provided valuable contextual information, it was through informal
 channels, wherein the most valuable information and analysis was provided
 ‘off the record.” Fieldwork for this project, clearly touched on highly
 political themes and issues, particularly in light of the then impending
 UNHRC session in late March 2014, due to which any external researcher
 was viewed as a ‘Western fact-finder.’ Thus most of the interviews with
 government agents and local NGOs had to be done with a degree of caution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jacobsen & Landau stress on the need for social scientists undertaking fieldwork
 in humanitarian situations to continuously maintain high academic and ethical
 standards, while avoiding the tendency to engage in advocacy research whereby
 ' researchers already know what they want to see and say, and come away
 from the research having “proved it.” '
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 They suggest that one way to mitigate against such “ethical traps” is to
 fully disclose the methodology which was used, including possible biases
 and the ethical dilemmas encountered in designing and executing it, which
 is what this section attempts to do.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is particularly important in the specific case of exploring government
 conditionalities, which are less overt than the local rejection process.
 Research on this specific type of local agency exercise was based on an
 assessment of the factors which led to the launch of the Joint Plan of
 Assistance for the Northern Province (2011) under the Presidential Task
 Force for Resettlement, Development and Security (PTF), the CLM donor response
 to this, and how this was related to the departure of donor agencies from
 the domestic arena.
 This involved conducting primary research through unstructured interviews
 with key international policy-makers from the UN and CLM donor agencies
 who were present in Sri Lanka during the time that the JPA was launched.
 This helped to grasp the Western donor perspective or narrative of how
 the trajectory of participating in the Sri Lanka post-conflict context
 had evolved after the war, as well as identify changes in donor strategy.
 Supported by testimonies recorded in International Crisis Group reports
 across years, the initial interviews also helped to piece together an understan
ding of what the intent and goal of peacebuilding during and after the conflict
 has been, and how this appropriately fits within existing theoretical work
 on peacebuilding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, a number of interviews were also conducted with key elected
 representatives to the Sri Lankan Parliament , the PTF in the Northern
 Province, members from prominent CSOs, and the Indian Donor Team based
 in Colombo and New Delhi.
 The interviews with government officials and local CSOs helped in understanding
 the ‘local’ institutional perspective on and resistance to Western peacebuildin
g, and further, to clarify the modes and the intent of exercising local
 agency either in favour or against this peacebuilding.
 The content from these interviews has helped to flesh out the government’s
 dilemma with regards to balancing external demands for accountability with
 local constrains demands for disassociation from the West.
 The interviews with the Indian Donor Team, on the other hand, helped clarify
 how the Sri Lankan government has worked with non-traditional or non-OECD
 donors, and if the similar conditionalities have been placed on Indian
 aid.
 This was felt to be relevant as while India is a non-Western donor, it
 has had a tumultuous and separate history of attempting to build peace
 in the Sri Lanka during the early years of the war.
 The value it added to this research was in helping identify what the Sri
 Lankan government’s alternative model of collaboration with external actors
 in the reconstruction process looks like.

 confidentiality is maintained unless stated otherwise.

Do no harm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The active presence of the researcher in a 'dangerous' fieldwork site generates
 several risks.
 There is a risk that those involved in the research are somehow punished
 by those in authority for the opinions that they hold.
 The principle of ' do no harm ' was therefore followed to the maximum extent
 possible.
 Donald Warwick discusses the risk that a researcher could be in danger
 of prosecution, imprisonment, death or torture for research that is seen
 as a threat to security.

 There is also potential harm to the research profession in such environments
 as the actions of a researcher may make it difficult for subsequent studies.
 This may either take place due to tougher restrictions on research and
 limitation on the movement of researchers by local authorities, or the
 inculcation of a culture of fear and/or aversion, where subjects becoming
 hardened to researchers or prefer to not participate in any further research.
 In an effort to prevent harm arising from the findings of this research,
 all quotes in this research are anonymous.
 To this end, all interviewees were assured that their identity would be
 kept strictly confidential and that they would never be identified as having
 participated in the research or as having said particular things

As Holt discusses, in a ‘divided society,’ there is a danger that all actors
 are perceived to be partisan based on family name, religion or residence;
 both ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ are subject to different but equally limiting

 As Fujii explains: not only are researchers studying their informants,
 their informants, in turn, are studying them back – to figure out who the
 researcher is and whether the researcher is a source of potential threat
 […] How informants identify researchers can determine the amount or level
 of access the researcher can gain.
 If people suspect that researchers are state agents, informants may invoke
 a party line in interviews and conversations rather than reveal their deeper
 thoughts.
 The task of the researcher is to take people's fears and suspicions seriously
 and try to allay them as much as possible.

In the case of this thesis, there was a degree of concern over the researcher's
 identity and intentions, specifically as an academic who is simultaneously
 perceived as being both 'foreign' (Indian citizen) and 'local' (Tamil surname).
 My family name was particularly problematic as it indicated that I was
 from South India, a region that has vociferously denounced the treatment
 of Sri Lankan Tamils, despite the Indian central government’s move to normalise
 relations and have a restricted dialogue on this contentious issue.
 Second, as earlier discussed, against the impended Geneva United Nations
 Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session of March 2014, where the international
 community was to vote on the setting up of an independent inquiry commission,
 any research by a ‘foreigner’ was problematic.
 That the academic institution I belonged to was in Geneva thus was often
 an issue.

The next chapter provides some contextual information on the nature of contempor
ary Western and peacebuilding engagement during Sri Lankan civil war.
 It presents the problematique wherein despite mainstream accounts that
 have focused on the failure of the West mediated peace-process as a consequence
 of the domestic elite’s instrumentalisation of ethno-nationalism, a more
 nuanced historical examination indicates that the resistance first emerged
 from the grass-roots.
 Till the end of the conflict in 2009, this resistance has played a crucial
 role in shaping the government’s agenda, which has depended on its support
 base amongst these groups in order to stay in power.
